                    <p>25/07/2022 - 19/08/2022 <br><br>
                    During my time as a Government Human resources officer, I was in the recruitment division. My day to day 
                    tasks were to ensure that candidates for job openings had submitted all of the required documentation to 
                    the office of Human resources. <br> <br>
                
                    Furthemore, after a couple of weeks I was in-charge of the OHR work load logging. This role was a crucial part 
                    of the OHR system, as it updated the work load spread sheet for employees.</p>

                    <p>During my time at Clintons retail, I was a shop floor associate. This meant that I served cutsomers at the
                    till and organised new and old stock on the shop floor.

                    <h4>Voluntary Work</h4>

                    <p>From a young age I had always been involved in helping out at the communities I was apart of.
                        However, in 2019 I decided to take helping out more seriously as I started coaching an under 11's 
                        cricket team. <br> <br> 

                        Moreover, Cricket is a sport that holds a special place in my heart, so to be able to help the next generation of 
                        cricketers become better players is very enjoyable and rewarding.
